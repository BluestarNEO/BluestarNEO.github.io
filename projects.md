####[*HTML5 | CSS3 Project*](https://github.com/BluestarNEO/html5-css3-project)

This Puppy Love site page was nothing more than a design image which then had to be re-created in HTML5 and CSS3 from the ground up.

####[*JavaScript | jQuery | Handlebars | Gulp Project*](https://github.com/BluestarNEO/twitter-project-v2)

Built using a simple JSON database, the purpose of this project was to test the use of JavaScript and jQuery while using front end templating
with Handlebars to build a mock version of Twitter. Build and Watch tasks were used through Gulp in order to facilitate a fully working development environment.

####[*HTML5 | CSS3 | JavaScript | jQuery | Backbone | Gulp | GitHub Group Project*](https://github.com/BluestarNEO/backbone-project)

- - -
Working with a team of 3 as Group Leader, our goal was to create a site that used the provided JSON database of users with Backbone for our
models, views, and collections. An additional objective was to populate the database with a new kind of object with its own properties and be
able to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) tasks on both the Users and Products. Agile development was used through a means
of Backlogs, Scrums, and Sprints. Additionally, version control was maintained through GitHub by means of Feature Merges and Pull Requests.

The purpose of NodeBots Day 2015 was to learn about the world of NodeBots and involved the assembling of a small robot kit and using Node.js to create some
controlled functionality. Outside of programming, additional knowledge was to be learned through the use of an Uno32 Development Board and 
electronic wiring such as breadboards and jumper cables.

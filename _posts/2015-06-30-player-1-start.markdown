Projects have to start somewhere, and at times, projects have to start over from beginning to be reborn into something even greater.
This is one such project as I blog about those things educational, fun, and exciting within the world of web development,
technology, and video games.

My older blog can still be found at [binaryLunchbox's WordPress site](http://binaryLunchbox.wordpress.com) and will serve only as
an archive for my past. Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy the journey!

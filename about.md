The name is Keith and I enjoy all things pertaining to the world of web development and video games. Graduating from the University of Central Florida
in 2014, I moved to Phoenix to break from my Florida roots and enjoy life out in Phoenix, Arizona. Now I'm on a mission to have
a successful career in web development, make friends, and enjoy just about everything in life that comes my way.
